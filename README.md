# Porescale Images Quantification Workshop

Files and scripts for the Jan. 12, 2024 Digital Porous Media (DPM) Industrial Affiliates Program (IAP) workshop on some quantifications of pore scale images.  

These scripts will be used as preprocessing quality checks on data to be used for federated learning. These contain some ideas of metrics that clients are permitted to share about the training data to ensure data quality and representativeness.

This workshop is organized into Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts including topics on computing the Minkowski Functionals (MFs), heterogeneity characterization, and competent subset selection.
